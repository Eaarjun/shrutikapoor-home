# Is your site accessible?

Being digitally accessible means your site should be able to be used by anyone - those with disabilities and those with abled bodies. Think about the last site you built, or your favorite site. Are you confident that anyone can use your site and perform the critical actions of the site? Have you considered folks with motor disability, visual disability, cognitive disability and auditory disability?

Often accessibility is left as an after-thought. When it is time to ship a feature, we do an accessibility test and find out that our site wasn't accessible and do a hacky fix. Making a site accessible is a huge undertaking but if we keep accessibility in mind from the get-go itself, it makes it much easier to build an accessible web app. In this post, I will go over 5 things you can keep in mind WHILE building your app so you don't have to do a hacky slap at the end.

# 5 things to keep in mind

1. Semantinc HTML
2. Tabindex
3. Aria attributes
4. Role
5. Keyboard navigation and screen reader

In short, S.T.A.R.K. If you need help remembering this, think of Tony Stark ![TonyStark](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55400215/ktokatitmir0.0.jpg)

## Semantic HTML

Using semantic HTML is important for accessibility. The reason is that assistive technologies such as screen readers are able to interpret what's on the page by parsing the HTML of the page. They enable users to take actions based on the elements. For eg, if a screen reader encounters `button`, it would signal the user to click on it. Let's consider some use-cases of what happens when semantic HTML is not used -

1. Creating buttons by using `div` instead of `button`: `div` are container elements so when a screen reader encounters a div, it automatically thinks it is a presentational element. When a screen reader user encounters a `div` that has content or children within it, screen reader would announce `role="group"` and the user will completely miss that the `div` is interactive. Therefore, use the proper semantic element for its purpose. You get accessibility for free.

2. Using CSS to fake headings instead of using `h1-6` tags: Heading tags such as `<h1>`, `<h2>` signal an assitive technology that this is important text and the screen reader will announce "Heading". When you use CSS to make a heading instead of using correct semantics, the significance of the text is lost to a screen reader.

So, in conclusion, use semantic HTML whenever possible.

## Tabindex

Adding a `tabindex` is a very widely used method to make interactive elements keyboard navigable. When `tabindex` is added to an element, a user is able to keyboard navigate to it and focus using assitive technologies.

`tabindex` should only have a value of `0` or `-1`. A tabindex of `0` is used to set focus to an element in the default tabbing order, and a tabindex of `-1` is used to programmatically focus an element using JavaScript. Do not assign a value of > 1 to tabindex.
A caution though - `tabindex` should only be added to interactive elements. It is not a good idea to add `tabindex` to elements such as `div`. Instead of adding tabindex, use a semantic element since semantic elements already are tabbable and do not need an additional `tabindex` value.

## Aria attributes

Aria attributes such as `aria-checked`, `aria-label` are used to give additional information to assistive technologies.

## Role

Aria roles such as `alert`, `grid`, `presentation` are assigned to elements to set their semantic values. For example, let's say you built a grid like element with the help of CSS and divs. You would use `role="grid"` to assign to this div element to let assistive technologies know about the type of the element.

## Keyboard navigation and screen readers

Every important element must be able to be navigated by a user using keyboard and screen reader. To do this, try navigating your site through a keyboard only.
