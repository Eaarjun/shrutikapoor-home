1. **Know Your Audience**
   Understand your audience's interests and needs to tailor your content effectively.

   - **Audience Expertise and Interests:** Before preparing your talk, consider the level of expertise your audience possesses. Are you addressing beginners who are eager to learn the basics, or are you speaking to seasoned professionals seeking advanced insights? Understanding this will help you customize your content accordingly.
   - **Gather Insights:** To gain valuable insights into your audience's preferences, talk to event organizers or conduct surveys. This will give you a better understanding of their expectations and what they hope to take away from your presentation.
   - **Balance Fundamentals and Advanced Insights:** If your audience consists of newcomers to the topic, focus on providing clear explanations of fundamentals, terminologies, and motivations. On the other hand, if you have an audience with intermediate to advanced knowledge, dive into the nitty-gritty, discuss pros and cons, share opinions, and share real-life experiences.
   - **Avoid Jargon Overload:** Ensure that your content is accessible to everyone by avoiding excessive use of jargon. Make complex concepts understandable by using clear language and providing relevant context.
   - **Gauge with Show of Hands:** During your talk, you can engage the audience by doing a show of hands to gauge their familiarity with the topic. Based on their response, you can offer a brief 101-style introduction for those who are new to the subject, or dive directly into the main content if most of the audience is already familiar.

2. **Work on the meat of the talk first**

   When preparing your conference talk, focus on developing the core content and the compelling story you want to share. Design and templates can be addressed later; prioritizing your message is key.

   - **Identify the Key Objective:** Start by answering this question: What is the one thing you want your audience to take away from your talk? This objective will be the central theme around which you build your narrative.
   - **Create a Mind-Map:** I find it helpful to create a mind-map of the topics I'll cover, centered around the main point I want my audience to remember. This approach ensures that your talk flows logically and maintains a clear focus throughout.

3. **Tell a story**

   As humans, we like storytelling. Instead of just talking through your content, frame the story around why you are sharing this. By telling a story that follows this format, you engage your audience on an emotional level, make your content more relatable, and leave a lasting impact. Here’s a template I like for storytelling is -

   - **Introduce the Problem:** Begin by describing a relatable problem or challenge you encountered. Paint a vivid picture to evoke empathy and interest from your audience.
   - **Highlight the Impact:** Illustrate the consequences and impact of the problem. Share the challenges and struggles you faced, allowing your audience to connect with your journey.
   - **Present the Solution:** Transition into the solution you discovered or devised. Explain how you tackled the problem and the thought process behind it. Make it clear why this solution was unique and effective.
   - **Celebrate the Improvement:** Describe how the solution improved your life or the lives of others involved. Share specific outcomes and successes resulting from your approach.
   - **Embrace the Journey:** Be honest about the ongoing nature of progress. Acknowledge that the journey may not be perfect, and there might be continuous efforts to maintain the positive changes.
   - **Empower Your Audience:** Provide actionable insights or advice for your audience to avoid or overcome similar challenges. Encourage them to apply your learnings to their own situations.

4. **Structure your talk**

   - **Start with a Captivating Hook:** Begin your talk with an attention-grabbing introduction. This could be an intriguing problem you encountered, a humorous joke, a compelling personal story, or a thought-provoking question. The hook sets the tone for your talk and piques the audience's curiosity.
   - **Keep Your Audience Anchored:** Recognize that maintaining audience attention is crucial. To keep them engaged throughout, provide a clear roadmap at the beginning of your talk. Briefly outline what you'll be discussing, so the audience knows what to expect. Throughout your presentation, periodically remind them of the main points you're covering and where you are in the narrative.

![An outline such as this helps to keep the audience anchored](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/08/image-109.png)

- **Deliver Smooth Transitions:** Practice delivering seamless transitions between slides and sections. This ensures that your presentation flows like a cohesive narrative. Familiarize yourself with your content to the extent that you know what slide comes next. Using presenter's view can be beneficial to preview the upcoming slide discreetly.
- **Strategically Reiterate Main Points:** Identify the core messages or key takeaways you want your audience to remember. Make a conscious effort to repeat these points at various stages of your talk, reinforcing their significance.

5. **Use visuals** A picture is a thousand words. We're naturally drawn to visuals over lengthy text.

- **Utilize a Variety of Visuals:** Incorporate images, graphics, GIFs, diagrams, illustrations, and charts to visually convey your ideas and captivate your audience. Visual elements help break the monotony of text-heavy slides and enhance the overall appeal of your presentation. Explore free platforms like Unsplash and Imgur to find high-quality visuals that align with the content of your presentation. High-resolution images and graphics add a professional touch to your slides.
- **Animate to Explain Concepts:** Animations can be a great way to explain complex concepts dynamically. Consider using subtle animations to illustrate processes or step-by-step explanations. As a reference, check out **[this talk](https://youtu.be/cCOL7MC4Pl0?t=318)** with impressive animations explaining the JavaScript event loop.
- **Demonstrate with Demos:** If your presentation includes a demo, start by showcasing the end product first. Then, take your audience through the process of building it step by step. This approach creates anticipation and helps the audience understand the context and value of your demo
- **AI-Generated Images:** For a creative touch, consider using AI-generated images created with tools like DALL-E or Midjourney. These unique visuals can add a distinctive element to your presentation. Check out this unique example of an AI generated image of a “avocado swimming in the ocean” that I created using DALL-E.

6. **Optimize Slide Design for Clarity**
   Creating visually clear and appealing slides is crucial to ensure that your conference talk is effectively delivered to all members of the audience, including those seated at the back of the room. Here are essential tips to optimize your slide design:

- **Use Large Fonts:** Opt for large, easy-to-read fonts that are visible from a distance. This ensures that even audience members at the back can comfortably follow your content without straining their eyes.
  ![An example of a slide that uses large fonts](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/08/image-104.png)
- **Concise Text:** Avoid lengthy sentences on your slides. Keep the text concise and to the point. Too much text can distract the audience from your spoken words and diminish their focus on your message.
- **Avoid Information Overload:** Refrain from cluttering your slides with excessive information. Stick to key points and use bullet points to convey your ideas succinctly. This allows the audience to grasp the main concepts without feeling overwhelmed.
- **Format Code Clearly:** When presenting code, use tools like **[carbon.sh](http://carbon.sh/)** to format it in a clean and readable manner. This ensures that even complex code is understandable to your audience.
- **Ensure Visible Contrast:** Check the visibility and color contrast of your content against the background. Do a dry-run on the day of your talk to confirm that the slides are clearly visible on the projector or screen. Monitors can have varying color resolutions, so it's essential to be prepared.
- **Avoid Distracting Design:** While visual elements can enhance your presentation, ensure that your design template doesn't distract from the main content. Keep it clean and professional to maintain focus on your message.

7. **Avoid Over-Reliance on Presenter Notes**

Presenter notes can be valuable tools for staying on track during your conference talk, but it's crucial to avoid relying on them too heavily. Here are key points to consider when using presenter notes effectively:

- **Stay Natural and Engaging:** Reading directly from presenter notes can make your presentation sound robotic and disengaging. Instead, aim to speak naturally and connect with your audience. Familiarize yourself with the content to the point where you can convey it in a conversational manner. Treat presenter notes as aids rather than a script. They should serve as a helpful guide to remind you of key points, transitions, or specific details, but not dictate your entire presentation.
- **Practice Makes Perfect:** Rehearse your talk multiple times until the content becomes ingrained in your memory. By knowing your material inside out, you'll be able to deliver it smoothly without relying solely on presenter notes.

8. **Keep your audience engaged**

Keeping your audience engaged is essential to ensuring the success of your conference talk. By incorporating various interactive elements, you can captivate your listeners and maintain their interest. Here are effective strategies to achieve this:

- **Inject Humor and Memes:** Light-hearted humor and relevant memes can add a touch of fun to your presentation. Well-timed jokes and amusing visuals help create a relaxed atmosphere and make your talk more enjoyable.
  - _Note on Jokes:_ If a joke doesn't land as expected, simply move on without dwelling on it. Avoid explaining the joke or making the audience feel uncomfortable for not getting it.
- **Interact with Your Audience:** Engage your audience by asking them questions or encouraging them to participate in brief activities. Interactive elements make your talk more dynamic and involve the audience in the discussion.
- **Offer Quick Breaks:** If your talk contains substantial content, consider giving the audience a quick break to recharge. This break can be as simple as taking a sip of water or pausing briefly to allow the audience to take screenshots of important slides.
- **Leverage Live Demonstrations:** Live demos are excellent ways to immerse your audience in your topic. Letting the audience interact with your demos, ask questions, and explore the process hands-on keeps them engaged and interested.
- **Share Swag or Resources:** If appropriate, consider offering swag such as stickers, or t-shirts. This can serve as an incentive for active participation and create a positive association with your talk.

9. **Share Resources for Ongoing Engagement**

Empowering your audience with valuable resources ensures that the impact of your conference talk extends beyond the event itself. Here are effective ways to share resources and foster continued engagement:

- **QR Codes for Accessibility:** Make it easy for your audience to access your slides and additional resources by displaying QR codes at the beginning of your talk. By scanning the code, attendees can quickly access relevant materials on their devices.
  ![A QR code that links users to codepen link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/08/image-106.png)
- **Tweet Links to Slide Deck:** Increase accessibility by tweeting links to your slide deck a few minutes before your talk. This allows people to access the content during your presentation and refer back to it afterward.
- **Provide GitHub or CodeSandbox URLs:** If you demonstrate a technical project, share the URL to the corresponding GitHub repository or CodeSandbox. This enables your audience to explore the project further and gain hands-on experience with the code.
- **Include Your Contact Information:** Display your name and contact information on every slide, ensuring that attendees can easily reach out to you after the talk. This is particularly helpful if they want to share the slides or contact you for further discussions or inquiries.
  ![An example of including your content information at the bottom of a slide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/08/image-108.png)
- **Give Action Steps:** Leave your audience with a call-to-action or "from here, do this" tasks related to the topic. This encourages individuals interested in learning more to take action and engage further with the subject matter.

10. **Make it Relevant for Your Audience, Not Just You**

Ensuring that your conference talk resonates with your audience is essential for creating a meaningful and impactful presentation. Consider the following points to make your talk relevant and valuable for your listeners:

- **Abstract the Problem and Solution:** If you're sharing a talk about a problem you encountered and the solution you formed, abstract the problem to make it relatable for the audience. Avoid overwhelming them with excessive technical details or specific scenarios that may not directly apply to their situations. Instead, focus on the core principles and broader implications that your audience can relate to and learn from.
- **Avoid Over-Marketing or Over-Selling:** While it's natural to be passionate about your work or product, avoid turning your talk into a promotional pitch. People attend conferences to gain knowledge and insights, not to be sold to. Provide valuable content that genuinely benefits your audience, and let the quality of your work speak for itself. Authenticity and value will naturally attract interest and followers.

  - _Note on Self-Promotion:_ Subtly promote your social media presence at the beginning and end of your talk, but do so in a non-intrusive manner. Mentioning your Twitter handle or other social links during the introduction and conclusion allows interested listeners to follow you for more content without feeling overwhelmed by constant promotion.

11. **BONUS: Where to find templates?**

I'm a fan of simplicity when it comes to design templates. There are various sources to find templates, such as Envato or Canva. Additionally, you can hire a designer from platforms like Fiverr or Upwork to create a custom template for you. Personally, I've refined my design template in Keynote over the years, and it's the one I use most frequently. [This is the](https://elements.envato.com/kitulah-google-slides-template-LQHBG6) template I started off with.
