```
console.log( null === undefined )
```

## Rule

An important rule of checking type with `null` or `undefined` is that in the equality equation above, the result will be true **only** if both sides are either `null` or `undefined`.

This is helpful in checking against falsy values such as following -

```
let c;
console.log(c == null);
// true

console.log(c == undefined);
// true

console.log(0 == null);
// false

console.log("" == null);
// false

```

One caveat: `==` should be rarely used. This is a good use case for when `==` can be used. If you are unsure whether to use `==` or `===`, use `===`.
