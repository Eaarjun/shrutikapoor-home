title: How to stay motivated as a developer and stop procrastinating. 
description: "Do you ever find it difficult to work on your project, your side hustle, or even your hobby? You ever had those moments where nothing feels exciting, everything feels boring, and you lay there in bed feeling - is it just me or is my work really that boring?  I feel it too. One week I feel super excited and feel I can do anything I put my mind to, the next I feel very low, bored and stuck and feel like I do not have the motivation to put even one line of code in. 
In this article, I want to discuss what to do when you feel you have no motivation to do anything, or can not collect yourself to focus on your task at hand.

Do you ever find it challenging to work on your project, side hustle, or even your hobby? Have you ever had those moments where nothing feels exciting? You lay in bed feeling - is it me, or is my work that boring? I have those days too. Some weeks I am charged up and determined to take over the world. The other weeks, I feel low, bored, and stuck, and I feel like I don't have the motivation to write even one line of code.

This article will discuss what to do when you are not motivated and procrastinating working.

## What to do when motivation depletes, and you have no excitement to work on anything?

We must remember that motivation comes in any shape or form. Some days, motivation looks like creating art, whereas other days, it inspires you to create a blog post. Some days it looks like going on a 7-mile hike, whereas other days, it is about taking care of yourself and working your ass off.

Acknowledge and appreciate the motivation and its form. Let it encompass you, take you on a ride, and bring you new experiences, joy, and fulfillment. Let yourself feel motivated - no matter what form it strikes in because motivation in one form bleeds into another.

Some days when I feel low, I pull out my paintbrushes, put on a Bob Ross painting tutorial, play my favorite show in the background, make myself a cup of tea, light a candle, and start painting. It feels good to use this time to de-stress. I don't care too much about the quality; I care about how I feel in the moment. I feel relaxed, inspired, motivated, and feel like I am taking care of myself and feeling creative while I am doing it. Even though I may not feel motivated to write code, I feel motivated to paint - and that's okay!

I then take that feeling to the next day - either to let my creativity work on my art or to help me create something else.

An important thing to remember is that motivation is fleeting. A burst of inspiration usually lasts 1 - 3 weeks. By only relying on motivation to fulfill your dreams and goals, you are not creating a strategy for being consistent. What you need is discipline. You need a system of habits. A habit system keeps you going day after day and becomes part of your daily routine, even when motivation has left you.

## What is a habit system, and how to create it?

It is a carefully thought-out daily routine of habits that take you closer to your goal. It is a system of what you need to do, how long you need to do it, what ambiance you want to create before you do the things you need to do, and how you will put yourself in the right mental frame of mind.

For example, as a developer, think about what goals you have set for yourself? They may look like this -

1. Week: create a feature for a project you are working on.
2. Month: Learn TypeScript
3. Quarter: Release project
4. Year:
   Be proficient in React, TypeScript
   Speak at a conference
   Create one blog every month.

Now, think about how you will break down these goals into tasks, and by what deadline are you hoping to get it done? Work backward from that deadline, and see what tasks you can achieve in the short term to achieve that goal. Here is an example of one of the above goals -

**Goal**: create a feature for a project you are working on

**Deadline**: 1 week from today.

**Steps**:

1. Research what I need- dependencies, stakeholders, assets.
2. What are the steps for creating this feature?
3. What are some open questions?
4. Who can help me?

**Timeline**:

Day 1: Research
Day 2 - 3: Development work + Testing
Day 4: End to end testing + fixing any bugs.
Day 5: Deploy to staging env and get ready for demo.

The next step is to "make" the time to do these steps. You carve out in your calendar to make it happen. Look at your calendar, and block out "focus time". This is the time when you will get these tasks done. Next, create a system of "setting the mental frame". This is how you will put yourself into being in the mood of getting work done.

## My Habit System

Here is the system that I use to keep myself on track -

1. Finding ideas - Often, I don't feel inspired to do anything because nothing is on my plate to do. I may have a lot of items in the backlog that I could work on, but I haven't given much thought to any of those ideas, and because I haven't "brought them on my plate," they don't feel as exciting. I go through my backlog or idealist and see if anything inspires me to overcome that. If not, I will browse blog articles on dev.to, freecodecamp, or Medium to see if any trending articles inspire creativity. If not, I will find exciting conversations on Twitter. If not, I will open Udemy or YouTube and find something to learn. If none of that works, it is a signal that I need to chill out and take time to myself. I give myself a "creative" break - go on a walk, listen to a podcast. When something does inspire creativity during this break, I will write it down.

2. Setting timelines - Once I have a few ideas in mind, I will pick the one that excites me the most. I will put a soft deadline for me - often two weeks. Then I will work backward from the deadline and mark time in my calendar to work on that topic. I usually set 1-hour slots in my calendar if my calendar is busy and longer if I have more time. Some weeks, I may only be able to carve out 2 hours, okay. Once it is on my calendar, I will force myself to sit down and get myself ready for focused work hours.

3. Setting a mood is crucial because having a good ambiance is vital for me and creates a stimulating environment. My stimulants are - sound, smell, and sight.
   **Sound**: I put on a lofi or focus playlist. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=JSByte&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=csCp0Wd2-40.) is the one I commonly watch.
   **Smell** - I have candles and diffusers set up in my office to create a "focus vibe". Sometimes, when I need a kick, I will also use roll-on essential oils.
   **Sight** - I feel most motivated when someone else is working with me or when I am outside in nature. This is why my work desk faces a window where I can see trees, wind blowing, leaves rustling, and birds chirping. In the youtube video I linked, the guy is also working, which makes me feel inspired to work. It's like having a working buddy. I created [a Twitch stream](http://twitch.tv/shrutikapoor?utm_campaign=JSByte&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=devto) and [discord server](https://discord.gg/rgqyH75Saf?utm_campaign=JSByte&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=devto) for this reason. When sitting in my home office alone is not enough to motivate me, and I need external motivation, I go to a cafe. Lately, I have also been going to a neighborhood park to write, which has been very helpful in creating articles.

4. Cutting out distractions - This is very important to me because I have an attention span of a goldfish. If given a chance, I will merrily browse away on Twitter, keep clicking notifications, or keep scrolling on Instagram. So during my focus time, I put my phone on silent, quit my email applications, and turn slack to Do not disturb mode. I tell myself - next 45 minutes, I will not look at my phone, answer emails, look at Twitter or open slack. If I need to stop getting distracted, I will log out of these applications. Out of sight, out of mind. üòÑ

5. Get it going - At this point, I have got my idea picked out, my vibe setup, my drink in my hand, my music playing, and the only thing I need to do is start typing. I begin my Pomodoro timer. I work in 45-minute sessions with 15-minute breaks. I use the video I linked above as my Pomodoro timer. My goal is that I should work through the whole video by the end of the day. Once the bell in the video hits "ding," I am ready. I start typing whatever comes to my head. I don't care much about polishing the content or code in the first go. This is a first go anyway. I will come back and revise the code/ content repeatedly. The idea is to get it going and get the juices flowing. It's all about getting your mind to dump on the page.

6. Take a break - Once the timer is up, it's time to take a break. I force myself to get up, take a walk, go outside, make a new cup of tea, do an errand - anything as long as it is not scrolling away mindlessly on Twitter or Instagram. This is the time for me to give myself a break. Sometimes towards the end of the break, around the 10-minute mark, I will check Slack, emails, or any urgent notifications on my phone. Sometimes, nobody needs me ‚òπÔ∏è so I get back to work for another 45-minute cycle.

7. Wrap it up - I realized during these sessions that to have continuity and be motivated in the next session, I need to know what I have accomplished, where I left off, and what I have to do next. For this, I will make notes at the end of the sessions, usually a revision of the above outline - What I did, what open questions I have, what I need to do in the next session, action items and people I need to reach out for help.

And so, the cycle repeats.
