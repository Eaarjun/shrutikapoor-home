Do you ever find it difficult to work on your project, your side hustle, or even your hobby? You ever had those moments where nothing feels exciting, everything feels boring, and you lay there in bed feeling - is it just me or is my work really that boring? I feel it too. One week I feel super excited and feel I can do anything I put my mind to, the next I feel very low, bored and stuck and feel like I don‚Äôt have the motivation to put even one line of code in.

In this article, I want to discuss what to do when you feel you have no motivation to do anything, or can not collect yourself to focus on your task at hand.

**What to do when motivation depletes and you have no excitement to work on anything?**

Motivation can come in any shape or form. Some days motivation looks like creating an art, whereas other days it is creating a blog post. Some days it looks like going on a 7 mile hike, whereas other days it is about taking care of your self and working your ass off.

Acknowledge and appreciate the motivation and its form. Let it encompass you, take you on a ride, and bring you new experiences, joy and fulfillment. Let yourself _feel_ motivated - no matter what form it strikes in. Because motivation in one form bleeds into another.

Some days when I feel low, I pull my painting colors out, put on a Bob Ross tutorial, play my favorite show in the background, make myself a cup of tea, light a candle and start painting. It feels good to use this time to de-stress. I dont care too much about the quality, I care about how I feel in the moment. I feel relaxed, inspired, motivated, and feel like I am taking care of myself, and feeling creative while I am doing it. Even though I may not feel motivated to write code, I feel motivated to paint - and that‚Äôs Okay!

That feeling I then take to the next day - either to continue working on my art, or to let my creativity help me create something else.

An important thing to remember is that motivation is fleeting. A burst of motivation usually lasts 1 - 3 weeks. Only relying on motivation to fulfill your dreams and goals isnt a good strategy for keeping consistency. What you need is discipline. You need a habit system. A habit system keeps you going day after day, and becomes part of your daily routine, even when motivation has left you. A daily habit system helps you get back in your chair every morning at 9AM after you are nicely showered and ready for your day.

**What is a habit system and how to create it?**

Simply put - it is a carefully thought out daily routine of habits that take you closer to your goal. It is a system of what you need to do, how long you need to do, what ambience you want to create before you do the things you need to do and how you are going to put yourself in a mental frame of mind.

For example, let‚Äôs say that you are a developer. Think about what goals you have set for yourself and what do you want to achieve? Your goals may look like this -

**Week**: create a feature for a project you are working on

**Month**: Learn TypeScript

**Quarter**: Release project / feature

**Year**: 1. Be proficient in React , TypeScript

1. Speak at a conference
2. Create one blog / month

Now, think about how you are going to break down these goals into tasks, and what timeline are you hoping to get it done by? Work backwards from that deadline, and see what tasks can you achieve in the short term to achieve that goal. Here is an example -

Goal: create a feature for a project you are working on

Deadline: 1 week from today (Sprint demo).

Steps:

1. Research what I need- dependencies, stakeholders, assets.

1. What are the steps for creating this feature?
1. What are some open questions?
1. Who can help me?

Timeline:

Day 1: Research

Day 2 - 4: Development work + Testing

Day 4: End to end testing + fix any bugs.

Day 5: Deploy to staging env and get ready for demo.

Now, the next step is to _make the time_ to do these steps. This is when you carve out time in your calendar to make it happen. Look at your calendar, block out ‚Äúfocus time‚Äù. This is when you will get these tasks done. Next, create a system of ‚Äúsetting the mental frame‚Äù. This is how you will put yourself into getting the mood of getting work done.

**My Habit System**

Here is my system that I use to keep myself on track or get myself back on track -

1. Finding ideas - Often times I don‚Äôt feel inspired to do anything because nothing is on my plate to do. I may have a lot of items in the backlog that I could work on, but havent really given much thought to any of those ideas and because I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúbrought them on my plate‚Äù, they don‚Äôt feel as exciting. To overcome that, I go through my backlog or idea list and see if anything inspires me. If not, I will browse blog articles on [dev.to](http://dev.to), freecodecamp or Medium to see if any of the trending articles inspire creativity. If not that, I will find interesting conversations on Twitter. If not that, I will open Udemy or YouTube and find something to learn. If none of that works, it is a signal for me that I need to chill out and take time to myself. I give myself time to break - go on a walk, listen to a podcast. When something does inspire creativity during this break, I will write it down.
2. Setting timelines - Once I have a few ideas in mind, I will pick the one that excites me the most. I will set a soft deadline for me - often two weeks. Then I will work backwards from the deadline, and add time in my week to work on the topic. I usually set 1 hour slots in my calendar if my calendar is busy, longer if I have more time. Some weeks I may only be able to carve out 2 hour time, and thats ok. Once it is in my calendar, I will force myself to sit down and get myself ready for focussed work hours.
3. Setting a mood - This is important to me, because having a good ambience is important for me and creates a stimulating environement for me. My stimulants are - sound, smell and sight.
   1. Sound: I put on a lofi or focus playlist. This is the one I commonly watch - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csCp0Wd2-40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csCp0Wd2-40).
   2. Smell - I have candles and diffusers set up in my office to create a focus vibe. Sometimes, when I really need a kick, I will also use roll-on essential oils.
   3. Sight - I feel most motivated when someone else is working with me, or when I am outside in nature. This is why my office space faces a window where I can see trees, wind blowing, hear leaves rustling and birds chirping. In the youtube video, the guy is working as well which makes me feel inspired to work. It‚Äôs like having a buddy. This is why I created [Twitch stream](http://twitch.tv/shrutikapoor) and [discord server](https://discord.gg/rgqyH75Saf). When sitting in my home office by myself is not enough to motivate me and I need an external factor, I go to a cafe. Lately, I also have been going to a neighbohood park to write and that has been very helpful to create articles.
4. Cutting out distractions - This is very important to me because I have an attention span of a goldfish. If given a chance, I will merrily browse away on Twitter, keep clicking notifications, or keep scrolling on Instagram. So during my focus time, I put my phone on silent, quick my email applications, turn slack to Do not disturb mode and I tell myself - next 45 minutes I am not going to look at my phone, asnwer emails, look at Twitter or open slack. If I really need to stop myself from getting distracted, I will log out of these applications. Out of sight, out of mind. üòÑ
5. Get it going - At this point, I have got my idea picked out, my vibe setup, my drink in my hand, my music playing, and the only thing I need to do is me to start typing. I start my pomodoro timer. I work in 45 minute sessions with 15 minute break. The video that I shared above is the one I use to work as my pomodoro timer. My goal is at the end of the day, I should finish this whole video and work through it. Once the bell in the video hits ‚Äúding‚Äù, I am ready. I start typing whatever comes to my head. I dont care about polishing the content or code in the first go. I will come back and revise the code/ content over and over again, so it doesn‚Äôt matter. The idea is to get it going and get the juices flowing. Its all about getting your mind to dump on the page. I will format my time in the following sections
   1. Things I need to do
   2. Open questions
   3. Next steps.
6. Take a break - Once the timer is up, its time to take a break. I will force myself to get up, take a walk, go outside, make a new cup of tea, do an errand, anything as long as it is not scrolling away mindlesslely on Twitter or Instagram. This is the time for me to give myself a break. Sometimes towards the end of the break around 10 minute mark, I will come back and check Slack, emails or any urgent notifications on my phone. Sometimes, nobody needs me ‚òπÔ∏è¬†so I will get back and get set to work another 45 minute cycle.
7. Ready to wrap it up - An important thing I realized during these sessions is that in order to have continuity, and be motivated to come back to the same work in the next session, I need to know what I have done before, where I left off and what needs to be done next. For this, I will make notes at the end of the sessions, usually a revision of the above outline -
   1. What I did
   2. What open questions I have
   3. What needs to be done in next sesssion
   4. Action items and people I need to reach out for help

And so the cycle repeats.

I hope this article helped you get inspired to create a habit system for yourself to keep you on track. If you would like to work together on Twitch or Discord, [DM me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/shrutikapoor08) telling me what is your preffered work schedule -

1. 9AM - 11AM PST Weekdays
