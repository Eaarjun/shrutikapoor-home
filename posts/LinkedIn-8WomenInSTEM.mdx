The tech industry has long been dominated by men, but there are many talented and successful women who have made significant contributions in technology. These women have not only made their mark in the industry but also inspired generations of women  in technology. Here are 8 inspirational women in technology:

**Ada Lovelace:** An English mathematician and writer, Lovelace is a pioneer in the field of computer programming. She was born in London in 1815. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, an early precursor to modern computer.  She was the first to publish an algorithm, thereby often being recognized as the first computer programmer.

**Marie Curie:** A physicist and chemist, Marie Curie is best known for her pioneering work in the field of radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields - Physics and Chemistry. She was born in 1867 and was known for discovering two elements - polonium and radium. Her work led to the development of X-Ray machines. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in the male-dominated field of science, she strived through and perserved, and inspired generations of women scientists. 

**Grace Hopper:** Grace Hopper was a pioneering computer scientist and naval officer who is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the early history of computing. Hopper was born in New York City in 1906, and went to Yale University before joining the US Navy during World War II. There, she worked on some of the earliest computers, including the Mark I, and helped to develop programming languages such as COBOL. Hopper continued to work for the Navy and for private industry throughout her long career, and was known for her advocacy of standards and for her efforts to make computers more accessible to non-technical users. Her legacy as a pioneer of computing and as an advocate for women in science and technology continues to inspire people today.

**Ursula Burns:** Ursual Burns is former CEO and Chairman of Xerox Corporation, and the first African American woman to head a Fortune 500 company. Ursula is a trailblazer in the tech industry and a role model for women and people of color. She is also a board member of several companies, including Uber and Nestle. Ursula's leadership and success have broken barriers and opened doors for others to follow in her footsteps.

**Katherine Johnson:** Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician whose work was crucial to the success of the early US space program. Katherine Johnson, born in 1953 in West Virginia, joined NASA's predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. There, she became known for her precise calculations, which were essential for the success of the first manned spaceflights. She was especially renowned for her work on the trajectory for the 1961 flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space. Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her contributions to the space program. Her life and work were featured in the book and film, "Hidden Figures". 

**Reshma Saujani** is an accomplished lawyer, activist, and politician, best known for founding the nonprofit organization, Girls Who Code. In 2012, Saujani launched Girls Who Code, an organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology by teaching girls to code. Since then, the organization has reached tens of thousands of girls across the United States and around the world. Saujani is also a frequent speaker and writer on issues related to women in technology, and she has been recognized for her advocacy work by numerous organizations and publications.

**Margaret Hamilton** is a computer scientist and software engineer who played a key role in the development of the software for the Apollo space program. Born in Indiana in 1936, Hamilton was hired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to work on the software for the Apollo program, and she led the team that developed the flight software for the Apollo 11 mission, which successfully landed humans on the moon for the first time in 1969. Hamilton's work on the Apollo software was pioneering in its use of error-checking and recovery protocols, which helped to ensure the safety and success of the mission. She went on to found her own software company and became an advocate for software engineering standards and for the role of women in computing. Hamilton has received numerous awards and honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

**Susan Wojcicki:** Susan was the CEO of YouTube until 2023 and previously served as senior vice president at Google. Susan has been instrumental in the growth and success of YouTube. She has also been named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people and Forbes' list of the world's 100 most powerful women. As a successful woman in the tech industry, Susan is a role model for young girls who aspire to be leaders in technology.
