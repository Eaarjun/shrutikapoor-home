React Server Components (RSC) is a new application architecture from React team that has been making headlines since it was first introduced in December 2020. In this blog post, we will dive deeper into React Server Components, how they work, and why they matter.

## What are React Server Components?

In short, React Server Components are a new type of React component that runs on the server and is excluded from the JavaScript bundle. This means that RSCs can run during the build process and read from the file system or access data layers without creating an API. RSCs run ahead of time, providing a significant improvement in app performance by reducing the time it takes for the app to load.

## How do React Server Components work?

## React Server Components vs. Server-Side Rendering

While both React Server Components and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) provide server-side rendering capabilities, they work differently. SSR allows you to display an HTML version of the client component, which is then downloaded and parsed when that HTML is loaded. RSCs provide a description of the rendered UI, allowing React to intelligently merge new data with the existing client component and make multiple refetches without losing state.

## What are the benefits of React Server Components?

One of the most significant benefits of React Server Components is their ability to improve app performance by reducing the time it takes for the app to load. By running ahead of time, RSCs can provide a more seamless user experience, reducing network round trips and data transfers, and improving app interactivity.
